# Basic UI Project

This project demonstrates creating a simple user interface (UI) using HTML and CSS. The goal is to create modern, interactive buttons and apply styles for different states such as hover, focus, and active.

## Project Structure

### 1. **HTML File (index.html)**

The `index.html` file contains the basic structure of the webpage. Elements include:
- A container for the buttons.
- Button classes used to apply different styles from the CSS files.

### 2. **CSS File (styles.css)**

The `styles.css` file defines the overall appearance and layout of the page. Features include:
- General layout settings like `box-sizing`, `font-family`, and `display`.
- Background and other styling properties used to arrange the page content.

### 3. **CSS File (buttons.css)**

The `buttons.css` file customizes the styling of the buttons. Features include:
- Button classes like `button-29`, `button-29-primary`, `button-29-outline-primary` for styling.
- Shadow, gradient colors, and hover/active effects for a modern look.
- Transition animations for changes when interacting with the buttons (hover, focus, active).

## Features

- **Interactive Buttons**: The buttons change visually with hover, focus, and active states, providing an interactive experience.
  - **Normal State**: The default appearance of the buttons.
  - **Hover State**: The buttons change visually when the user hovers the mouse over them.
  - **Focus State**: The buttons change visually when they are focused.
  - **Active State**: The buttons change visually when they are clicked and pressed.

- **Modern CSS Effects**: Gradient color transitions, shadows, and smooth transition animations create a clean and elegant design.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the UI.
3. Customize the button styles by editing the `buttons.css` and `styles.css` files.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates creating modern, interactive buttons using HTML and CSS and adding smooth animations. The `buttons.css` file defines button-specific styles, while `styles.css` controls the page layout.
